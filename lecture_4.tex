\begin{frame}{Meta-language vs object language}

Types and programs form a language, which are talked about by a separate language of judgements and derivations.
In this case we call the former  the \emph{object language}, and the latter the \emph{meta-language}.

What we write down as types and programs are nothing more than certain syntax trees by themselves; then, at a higher level, we organise and relate these syntax trees with judgements and derivations.

For example, equality judgements are a meta-theoretic notion and cannot be used inside the theory to state equations as provable propositions --- we need identity types instead.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Type theory should eat itself}

Judgements and derivations can also be regarded as syntax trees to be reasoned about.
For example, consistency is a statement in which judgements and derivations are the object language and English is the meta-language.
(Canonicity is another example.)

We can also use Agda as the meta-language!

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Implicational fragment of propositional logic}

Today we consider only propositions formed with implication.

Each of these propositions is a finite tree whose internal nodes are implications and whose leaves are atomic propositions, which are elements of a given set |Var = { A, B, C, {-"\text\ldots"-} }|.

\marker{Example} The proposition |(A -> B -> C) -> (A -> C) -> B -> C| is represented as
\[
\tikz[every node/.style={draw}, every child/.style={level distance=5.5ex}, level 1/.style={sibling distance=10em}, level 2/.style={sibling distance=5em}, level 3/.style={sibling distance=2.5em}]
  \node [circle] {$\to$}
    child { node [circle] {$\to$}
              child { node [circle] {\kern-.75pt$A$} }
              child { node [circle] {$\to$}
                        child { node [circle] {\kern-.5pt$B$} }
                        child { node [circle] {\kern-2pt$C$} } } }
    child { node [circle] {$\to$}
              child { node [circle] {$\to$}
                        child { node [circle] {\kern-.75pt$A$} }
                        child { node [circle] {\kern-2pt$C$} } }
              child { node [circle] {$\to$}
                        child { node [circle] {\kern-.5pt$B$} }
                        child { node [circle] {\kern-2pt$C$} } } };
\]

\begin{frame}{Natural deduction}

Natural deduction is the type part of simple type theory (and we are considering only the implicational fragment).

\[ \AXC{}
\rule{assum}\UIC{|Gamma ENTAILS p|} \DP \quad\text{when } |p| \,\in\, |Gamma| \]

\[ \AXC{|Gamma , p ENTAILS q|}
\rule{$\to$I}\UIC{|Gamma ENTAILS p -> q|} \DP \]

\[ \AXC{|Gamma ENTAILS p -> q|} \AXC{|Gamma ENTAILS p|}
\rule{$\to$E}\BIC{|Gamma ENTAILS q|} \DP \]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Untyped $\lambda$-calculus}

A $\lambda$-term is either a variable, an abstraction, or an application.

We usually assume \emph{$\alpha$-equivalence} of $\lambda$-terms, i.e., the names of \emph{bound variables} do not matter.
\begin{itemize}
\item Change of bound variable names is called \emph{$\alpha$-conversion}, which has to be \emph{capture-avoiding}, i.e., \emph{free variables} must not become bound after a name change.
\item In formalisation, we prefer not to deal with $\alpha$-equivalence explicitly, and one way is to use \emph{de~Bruijn indices} --- $\lambda$'s are nameless, and a bound variable is represented as a natural number indicating to which~$\lambda$ it is bound.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Simply typed $\lambda$-calculus (à~la Curry)}

$\lambda$-calculus was designed to model function abstraction and application in mathematics.
In untyped $\lambda$-calculus, however, we can write nonsensical terms like |\x BIND x x|.

We can use the implicational fragement of propositional logic as a type language for $\lambda$-calculus, ruling out nonsensical terms.

\[ \AXC{}
\rule{var}\UIC{|Gamma ENTAILS x : p|} \DP \quad\text{when } |x : p| \,\in\, |Gamma| \]

\[ \AXC{|Gamma, x : p ENTAILS t : q|}
\rule{abs}\UIC{|Gamma ENTAILS \x BIND t : p -> q|} \DP \]

\[ \AXC{|Gamma ENTAILS t : p -> q|} \AXC{|Gamma ENTAILS u : p|}
\rule{app}\BIC{|Gamma ENTAILS t u : q|} \DP \]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Curry--Howard isomorphism}

Derivations in natural deduction and well-typed $\lambda$-terms are in one-to-one correspondence.

That is, we can write two functions,
\begin{itemize}
\item one mapping a logical derivation in natural deduction to a $\lambda$-term and its typing derivation, and
\item the other mapping a $\lambda$-term with a typing derivation to a logical derivation in natural deduction,
\end{itemize}
and can prove that the two functions are inverse to each other.

This result is historically significant: two formalisms are developed separately from logical and computational perspectives, yet they coincide perfectly.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Simply typed $\lambda$-calculus à~la Church}

The Curry--Howard isomorphism points out that derivations in natural deduction are actually $\lambda$-terms in disguise.

These $\lambda$-terms are intrinsically typed, so every term we are able to write down is necessarily well-behaved, whereas in simply typed $\lambda$-calculus à~la Curry, we can write arbitrary $\lambda$-terms, and only rule out ill-behaved ones via typing later.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Semantics}

After defining a language (like the implicational fragment of propositional logic), which consists of a bunch of syntax trees, we need to specify what these trees mean.

Judgements and derivations (which form a \emph{deduction system}) assign meaning to the propositional language by specifying how it is used in formal reasoning.

We can also translate the syntax trees into entities in a well understood semantic domain.
In the case of propositional logic, we can translate propositional trees to functions on truth values. (This is the classical treatment.)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Two-valued semantics of propositional logic}

\begin{itemize}

\item Define |BOOL DEFEQ { false, true }|.

\item An \emph{assignment} is a function of type |V -> BOOL|.

\item A proposition~|p| is translated into a function |(sem p) : (V -> BOOL) -> BOOL| mapping assignments to truth values.

\item An assignment~|sigma| \emph{models} a proposition~|p| exactly when |(sem p) sigma| is true, and \emph{models} a context~|Gamma| exactly when it models every proposition in~|Gamma|.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Two-valued semantics of propositional logic}

\begin{itemize}

\item A proposition~|p| is \emph{satisfiable} exactly when there exists an assignment that models~|p|, and is \emph{valid} exactly when every assignment models~|p|.

\item A proposition~|p| is a \emph{semantic consequence} of a context~|Gamma| (written $|Gamma| \models |p|$) exactly when every assignment that models~|Gamma| also models~|p|.

\end{itemize}

\marker{Exercise} Show that |(p -> p -> q) -> (p -> q)| is valid for any propositions |p|~and~|q|.

\marker{Exercise} Show that a proposition~|p| is valid if and only if |p|~is a semantic consequence of the empty context.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Relationship between deduction systems and semantics}

Natural deduction is \emph{sound} with respect to the two-valued semantics: whenever we can deduce $|Gamma| \vdash |p|$, it must be the case that $|Gamma| \models |p|$.

The implicational fragment of propositional logic is also \emph{(semantically) complete} with respect to the two-valued semantics: if $|Gamma| \models |p|$, then we can construct a derivation of $|Gamma| \vdash |p|$.
